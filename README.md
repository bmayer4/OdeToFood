This repository contains source for Scott Allen's, "ASP.NET Core 1.0 Fundamentals" course on Pluralsight.com. The origial source code is based on a release candidate and required modification to be compatible /w ASP.NET Core 1.0.

Generally, I created one branch per lesson so it is possible to see what the source looked like at each stage of the course. I also added a few notes where Scott made an interesting point during the course. 

If you're having trouble with the course, feel free to use this code as a reference.
